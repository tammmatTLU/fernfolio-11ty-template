T﻿his project was created for a front-end development course this semester.

## T﻿ask

The aim was to create an application similar to TypeRacer, where the user could type the provided words as fast and accurately as they could and a score would be calculated based on their performance, which would be used to rank them in the built-in leaderboard. This time there were certain styling requirements to do with CSS pseudo-classes and media-queries. I decided to go with a darker theme with different shades of red to compliment the darker background-tones. I also tried out box-shadows to create a glowing/neon effect for borders and other elements.

## P﻿review

A﻿s can be seen, the styling is still not quite there, but at the time of development it was the best I could do.
