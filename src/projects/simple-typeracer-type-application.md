T﻿his project was created for a front-end development course this semester.

## T﻿ask

T﻿he aim was to create a simple digital clock web-application which would have a set theme and a list of different customization options which you could use in the GUI to interact with/change the clock in one way or another.

I﻿ chose to make a video-game themed clock in which you had 3 different games to choose from. Depending on which game was chosen, the clock was rendered using a different background image, font-family and text color. In addition to that you could change the text size, timezone and language of the clock from the "Modify" modal window, which popped up when the respective button was clicked. Finally, you could use the arrow-buttons on your keyboard to move the clock to wherever you wished on the screen, but not outside of the viewport's dimensions.
