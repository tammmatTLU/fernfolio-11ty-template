## Mattias

H﻿ello, I am Mattias Tamm, a first-year Computer Science student at Tallinn University and this is my portfolio page created for a course I had this semester. As I said, I have formally been studying Computer Science for only a year, but I did have some previous experience with programming from courses I took in high school and even earlier. I haven't really figured out which part of Comp Sci fascinates me the most as there is a lot I haven't gotten to try yet, but so far I can confidently say I enjoy working with databases and like full-stack web development.

## T﻿his portfolio

T﻿his portfolio is created using Netlify and the Fernfolio Eleventy template and is filled with information pertaining to my work and experiences in web and software development. There isn't much to display as of yet but it is something.
